### Overview

**You’ve come a long way, and it's time to show it.** This will be your most advanced project to date.

**You get to call the shots and invent your own idea** and **tackle something that'll push you a little outside of your comfort zone.** You are **required** to use React for this project.

Make sure you review your project proposal with an instructor so you can make sure it's **something that represents the breadth of your learning**, and make sure it's **something that looks nice**!

---

### Presentation (Thursday)

* After running your idea by an instructor, be prepared to share your project idea with the class first thing Thursday morning.
* Be sure to answer the question: "Why would a user want to use your app?".
* Presentation format is your call, but please limit it to 5 minutes.

### Technical Requirements

Your app should:

* **Be a full-stack application** with well-styled views on the front-end supported with data and functionality from your own backend.
* **Have an interactive front-end** resulting in a great UX - sounds like a great use case for a SPA.
* **Be relatively comprehensive**. For example:
	* CRUD multiple related data models.
	* Consume a third-party API.
	* Implement authentication and authorization.
	* Consider implementing an admin feature if it makes sense.
* **Implement thoughtful user stories** prioritized to help guide you.
* **Be deployed online** so that it's publicly accessible.

### Necessary Deliverables

* A **working, full-stack application** that uses React on the front-end, that's hosted somewhere on the internet (Heroku).
* Your application **MUST** have authentication.  The use of JSON Web Tokens for authentication/authorization **is HIGHLY recommended**.
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project.
* A **`README.md` file** with:
    * **Introduction** to the app with a screenshot.
    * List of the **technologies** used.
    * Links to your Trello board and deployed app in a **Getting Started** section.
    * Descriptions of any **Unsolved Problems** (if any).
    * Descriptions of **Future Enhancements**.

* A **Trello board** that contains:
    * The app's **user stories** organized in the appropriate list (Ice Box, Current/MVP and Completed), moving from left to right.
    * The app's **wireframes** – sketches of the major "screens" of your UI in your application.
    * The app's **EDM** diagramming your models and their relationships.

### Self-sufficiency / Project Assistance

* Being able to find the the answers to your development issues is of paramount importance. 
* Feel free to use all resources available and collaborate with others, however, assistance from your instructors will be limited to **10** fifteen minute sessions - use them wisely!

### Suggestions to Get Started

* **Don’t get too caught up in too many awesome features** – simple is always better. Build something impressive that focuses on one major purpose.
* Review fundamentals of React as this **must** be used.
* **Design first.** Planning with user stories & wireframes before writing code means you won't get distracted changing your mind – you'll know what to build, and you can spend your time wisely by just building it.
* **Keep user stories small and well-defined**, and remember – user stories focus on what a user needs, not what development tasks need accomplishing.
* When you have complex application logic, **write pseudocode before you write actual code**. Thinking through the logic of something in plain English helps.
* **Read the docs for whatever technologies / frameworks / API’s you use**.

---

### Best Practices

* **Write your code DRY**
* In a SPA, communication with the backend is via AJAX.  Build **RESTful APIs to CRUD your data entities (resources)** and perform other functionality via AJAX.
* **Be consistent** with your code style.
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* **Write code another developer wouldn't have to ask you about**. Do your naming conventions make sense? Would another developer be able to look at your app and understand what everything is?
* **Make it all well-formatted.** There is no excuse for non-perfect indentation. Can we find the start and end of every div, curly brace, etc?
* **Comment your code where it makes sense**. Most code is self-documenting, however, comments help explain complicated code.
