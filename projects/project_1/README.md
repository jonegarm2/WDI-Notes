# Project 1: Client-side Game

## Overview

Your first WDI project will start out with something fun - **a game!**

Everyone will get a chance to **be creative**, and work through some really **tough programming challenges**.  You got your feet wet
with Tic-Tac-Toe, now it's time to step it up a notch.

**You will be working individually for this project**, but we'll be guiding you along the process. Additionally, you will have access to up to 10 one-on-one sessions with your instructors.

As a reminder, your project's code **must be substantially yours**. Do not copy code from other similar projects or other sources. However, relying on techniques and a line of code here and there found on StackOverflow is okay.

## Technical Requirements

### Due this Thursday Morning:

- Share your choice of game.
- A wireframe of your "main" game screen.
- Pseudocode for the overall game play.
- Optional: Additional wireframes and/or pseudocode of specific functionality.

### Your App (presented next Friday):

- Render a game in the browser.
- **Code win and/or loss logic and render win/loss messages in HTML.** Popup alerts using the `alert()` method are okay during development, but not production.
- **Include separate HTML, CSS & JavaScript files**. Use **semantic HTML** where possible.
- Have **properly indented HTML, CSS & JavaScript**. In addition, ensure that your vertical whitespace is consistent.
- No remaining **dead (code that will never be called) and/or commented out code**.
- Have functions and variables that are named sensibly. Remember, functions are typically named as verbs and variables (data) named as nouns.
- Stick with **KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)**. Don't attempt to implement a computer opponent.  This typically requires AI which is beyond the scope of WDI.
- Write **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** code. Check for repeating code and refactor into functions that accept arguments.
- **Use native Javascript or jQuery** for **DOM manipulation** - your choice. However be consistent - it's not wise to mix & match techniques.
- **Deploy your game online** using GitHub Pages so that the rest of the world can play your game!

## Necessary Deliverables

- **A ``readme.md`` file** with these sections at a minimum:
  1. **\<Your game's title\>**: A description of your game.  Background info of the game is a nice touch.
  1. **A screenshot** or screenshots of your actual game makes your readme more colorful :)
  1. **Technologies Used**: List of the technologies used.
  1. **Getting Started**: In this section include the link to your deployed game. 
  1. **Next Steps**: Unsolved problems and/or planned features.
- The code for **a working game, built by you**, hosted on GitHub Pages (covered next week),
  with frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project. Commit often, but don't commit broken code. Also, your commit messages should be in the present tense, e.g., "Style gameboard" instead of "Styled gameboard".

> Note: Don't underestimate the value of a `readme.md` well done. Prospective employers will evaluate your `readme.md` file!

### Choose From the Following Games

> Note: Games are listed in approximate order of increasing difficulty.

1. **Hangman** (theming is encouraged)
1. **Connect Four**
1. **War** (the card game)
1. **Blackjack**
1. **Slot Machine**
1. **Simon**
1. **Mancala**
1. **Dots & Boxes** (the game played on graph paper)
1. **Minesweeper**
1. **Othello/Reversi**
1. **Checkers** (no AI required - player vs. player instead)
1. **Solitaire**
1. **Battleship** (would require a little AI to implement a computer opponent)

## Suggestions

- Refer to the [Guide to Building a Browser App](https://github.com/ga-students/wdi-dt-57/blob/master/work/w01/d5/03-guide-to-building-a-browser-app.md)!
- **Begin by wireframing.** Think generally about how you'd
  like your game to look.
- **Pseudocode**. Think about how your game will work.  Ponder what a user does or might do when interacting with your game.
- **Identify/list the possible state** (variables) necessary to keep track of the game's status or display.
- **Use your Development Tools** (`console.log`, DevTools' debugger, `alert` statements) to debug and solve issues.
- **Commit early, commit often.** Donâ€™t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
- **Consult documentation resources** (MDN, jQuery, etc.) to better understand methods, etc.
- **Theme your game** to give it a more personal touch and make it more unique!
- Be sure to review the [Peer Code Review Checklist](./p1_peer_code_review.md) for important tips - your code will be evaluated using this checklist.

## Project Feedback + Evaluation

- Your instructors will be evaluating your project during your demonstration as well as reviewing the code in your repo.
- If there are deficiencies in meeting the requirements, you will be given guidance on what needs to be done to meet the requirements.  Your updated project will be due **9AM** Monday morning following demo Friday.
- If there is a specific section of code that you would like an instructor to provide additional feedback, please ask.
- After project presentations, there will be a "final unit 1 code challenge".
