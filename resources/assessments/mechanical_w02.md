# Week 2 Mechanical - NAME: ____________ `__/11` 

### Array Iteration

##### 1. Declare a variable named `turtles` and assign an array containing the strings "Donatello", "Leonardo", "Michelangelo", and "Raphael":
<br><br>
 
##### 2. Write a `forEach` loop to `console.log` each name in _turtles_, appending the string " likes pizza" to each name:
<br><br>

### Classes

```js
  class Turtle {
      constructor(name, maskColor) {



      }
    
    
    
    
  }
```
#### Complete the following code inside of the `Turtle` class above:

##### 3. Such that new turtle objects created will have their `name` and `maskColor` properties assigned.
##### 4. Add a `sayName` method that console.logs â€œI am " and appending the turtle's `name`.

##### 5. Write the line of code below that uses the `Turtle` class above to create a turtle object with a `name` of "Leonardo" and a `maskColor` of "blue"; and assign the new object to a variable named `leo`:
<br><br>
 
### Objects

```js
var car = {make: 'Toyota', year: 2017, model: 'Prius'};
```

##### 6. Write a JS expression (just the expression, don't assign to a variable) that returns the value of the `car` object's `model` property using **dot notation**:<br><br>

##### 7. Write a JS expression that **accesses** the value of the `car` object's `year` property using **square bracket notation**:<br><br>

##### 8. Define an object literal and assign to a variable named `account`. Within the object literal, include an `accountNo` property that holds a string of your choosing and a `balance` property that holds a number of your choosing. Finally, include a method (property that holds a function) named `print` within the object literal that would console.log a string formatted as<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Account No: AAAAAA / Balance: BBBBB**<br>substituting the values of `accountNo` and `balance` for AAAAAA and BBBBB:<br><br><br><br><br><br>

### Functions and Callbacks

##### 9. Write a function named `add` that has two parameters and RETURNS the sum of those two parameters:
<br><br>

##### 10. Write a function named `calculate` that accepts two numbers and a callback function as arguments.  Code the `calculate` function such that it will RETURN the result of invoking the callback function, passing to it the two numbers:
<br><br><br>

##### 11. Invoke the `calculate` function (defined in question #9 above), passing to it these arguments: 20, 15, and the `add` function (defined in question #8 above):
<br><br>
