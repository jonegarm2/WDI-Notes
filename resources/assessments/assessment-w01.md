### Bash (Terminal)

#### For EVERY question in this section, assume the working (current) directory is `$ ~/buffy`:

1. Make two directories inside `~/buffy`: `scoobies` and `vamps`:
<br><br><br>

2. Create files in `scoobies` named `buffy.txt` and `angel.txt`:
<br><br><br>

3. Copy `angel.txt` into the `vamps` directory:
<br><br><br>

4. Delete the `vamps` directory and everything inside it:
<br><br>

### JS Variables

1. Assign the string "Ahab" to a variable named `captain`:
<br><br>

2. Using the `captain` variable instead of the text "Ahab", use string concatenation to form the string "Oh Ahab, my Ahab!", assigning it to a variable named `phrase`:
<br><br>


### JS Conditionals
```js
var souls = 3;
var lifeRafts = 2;
```

1. Assuming the above variables, write an `if` statement that console.logs "SOS!" if there are more `souls` than `lifeRafts` (no need to write a function, just the `if` statement:
<br><br>


### Data Structures - JS Arrays

1. Create an array named `weekend` with just a string 'Saturday' in it:
<br><br>

2. Add the string 'Sunday' to the end of the `weekend` array:
<br><br>

3. Now add the string 'Friday' to the front of the `weekend` array:
<br><br>

4. Using square bracket notation, access 'Saturday' in the `weekend` array and assign to a variable named `day` (Note: the array has three days in it as this point):
<br><br>

5. Remove 'Friday' from the array:
<br><br>

### Data Structures - JS Objects

1. Write an object literal named `brain` having a property of `energyLevel` with a numeric value of `10`:
<br><br>

2. Assign the property of `energyLevel` to a variable named `energy`:
<br><br>

3. Add a `dream` property to the `brain` object that holds the string  'electric sheep':
<br><br>

### JS Functions

1. Write a function named `computeArea` that has two parameters, `length` & `width`, and **returns** the area of a rectangle (the product of `length` and `width`):
<br><br><br><br>

2. Invoke the `computeArea` function with `3` and `4` as arguments and save the returned result to a variable named `area`:
