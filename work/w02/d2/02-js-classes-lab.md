# JS Classes - Lab

## Intro

Now that you've learned about using **classes** in JavaScript to create objects, it's time for some practice!

## Lab

In this lab, you will choose one of the object hierarchies below, **Bank Accounts** or **People**, and write the classes to implement it.

### Bank Accounts

**`BankAccount`** class:

| Derived From | Properties | Methods |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| n/a | `ownerName`, `begBalance`, `acctNum` (generated by class - not passed in) | `deposit`, `withdraw` |

**`CheckingAccount`** class:

| Derived From | Properties | Methods |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| `BankAccount` | `overdraftEnabled` (in addition to BankAccount's) |  Override `withdraw` to implement overdraft feature |

**`SavingsAccount`** class:

| Derived From | Properties | Methods |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| `BankAccount` | None additional to BankAccount's |  Override `withdraw` to disallow withdrawals |


### People

**`Person`** class:

| Derived From | Properties | Methods |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| n/a | `firstName`, `lastName` | `sayHello` |

**`Employee`** class:

| Derived From | Properties | Methods |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| `Person` | `company`, `wage`, (in addition to Person's) | `receiveRaise` (increases wage), `terminate` (set an `active` prop to false |

**`Manager`** class:

| Derived From | Properties | Methods |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| `Employee` | `department` (in addition to Employee's) | `giveRaise` (calls `receiveRaise` on another object) |

**`Worker`** class:

| Derived From | Properties | Methods |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| `Employee` | `manager` (holds a Manager object, in addition to Employee's properties) | Your choice! |


## Deliverables

A saved _repl.it_ (or other code playground project) that:

- Defines the chosen class hierarchy using JS classes.

- Creates at least one instance of each class.

- Logs out the instances' properties and results of method calls.

#### One Solution

Try not to peak, but [here's an implementation](https://repl.it/GjTg/10) of the `People` class hierarchy.
