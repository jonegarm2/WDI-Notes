# Ruby Weekend

![Ruby](http://zohararad.github.io/presentations/falling-in-love-with-ruby/presentation/images/ruby.png)

### Things to checkout:

- [_Why's (Poignant) Guide_](http://www.rubyinside.com/media/poignant-guide.pdf)
  - Read as much as you are able to...
  - Keep going if you have time (it's an "interesting" book!)
  - Listen to the [soundtrack](http://poignant.guide/soundtrack/) while you read!
- **Please complete this codeschool [Intro to Ruby](http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0)**
  - If you want additional practice, you can do the free stuff at [Codecademy Ruby Course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-ruby) 
- Look up [Matz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukihiro_Matsumoto) and fall in love
- Do [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/) to practice your JavaScript and try out some Ruby challenges.  For now, I'd recommend sticking to the _8th kyu_ katas. Filter them by popularity! The most popular _8th kyu_ challenges are usually the most straightforward!

# AND GET SOME REST!
