# Building Our First React App 

Today is going to work a little differently than usual. We are going to learn React by building a simple React application multiple times. 

## Your Goal

# **Your goal for today should be memorizing the steps required to build a simple To Do app in React, so by this time tomorrow you can build a simple To Do app without the help of any external resources.**

## Iterations 

### Iteration 1: I Build (Laptops Closed)

I will build the application in front of you. You should ask questions and take extensive detailed notes on each step. 

### Iteration 2: We Build

We will then build the application as a class. One of you will be randomly selected to lead us through each one of the steps below.

1. Start the application 
    - create the application using `create-react-app`
    - set up the file structure
    - mount `<App />` to the DOM in `index.js`
    - create the `Components` directory

2. Create the `<App />` component  
    - initializes state 
    - write the `addItem` and `updateTodo` class methods
    - render the `<AddTodo />` and `<TodoItem />` components 

3. Write the `<AddTodo />` component

4. Write the `<TodoItem />` component

5. (If applicable): Fix any bugs in the final application

During this time I ("Teacher Jon") will be merely a spectator who will answer questions when asked them. You can treat me like Google.

### Iteration 3: You Build

Build the To Do app a third time on your own this time.

### Iteration 4: After Hours Extensions 

Add the ability to delete a Todo. Also make sure you can answer the Essential Questions below.

### Glossary 

These are some terms you should make sure you can define in the context of React application development.

* **state**
* **props** 
* **component** 
* **controlled component**
* **unidirectional data flow**
* **class component**
* **stateless functional component**

### Essentials Questions 

1. What does the `setState()` method do?
2. What does the `render()` method do?
3. What are props and how do we pass props from parent component to child component?
4. What is state? What is the difference between props and state?
5. What is JSX? What do components return?
