### Practice Lab

- Looking for some more practice exposing an API for an app?  Good...

- Start with your completed _mongoose\_movies_ lab project from last week (or use the supplied starter code - don't forget to `npm install`).

- Create a full RESTful API for the `movies` resource.

- Collaborate as necessary and smile!
